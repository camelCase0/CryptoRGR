# CryptoRGR
## Program for making tasks in cryptography
## Task 2. Linear shift register(LSR)
Calculate the state of the LSR in the N-th cycle, if initial filling and the feedback polynomial of this LRZ have
## Task 3. Guadratic congruent generator
Using a quadratic congruent generator, gets a pseudo-random sequence of 20 elements

$a = N + 32, b = N + 59, с = N + 94$

>As random bits, take the least significant bit of the number in binary notation.
## Task 4. RSA signature

Create an RSA signature for the hash image of the name

To create hash, use the hash function:
$\(2^{(H_i - 1)})^{M_i} \mod n\$, where $n=p*q$. 

The initialization vector $H_0$ should be chosen equal to $N + 13$. Select random keys for RSA signature

## Task 5.
